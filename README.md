# MERN-TODO-APP :clipboard:


Minimal full-stack MERN app where the user has the ability to ADD/EDIT/UPDATE/DELETE todos. All the todos are saved on MongoDB Atlas.

This project uses the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for frontend
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact) for state management between React components

```javascript
// Install dependencies for server & client
npm install && npm run client-install

// Run client & server with concurrently
